## TODO

- EASY.  Wait for a response.
- EASY.  Nicer exception handling.
- EASY.  Make it run under python 3.
- EASY.  Populate a set of default headers if they're not specified in the input.
- EASY.  Move from optparse to argparse.
- EASY.  Add warning if validation is disabled.  Include option to silence warnings.
- MEDIUM.  Automatically populate SIP values based on destination and source values.
- MEDIUM.  Option to use TCP instead of UDP.
- MEDIUM.  Some tests would be nice...
- HARD.  Validate the input is valid SIP.
